# mnist_tsne_animation
1. visualization of MNIST network LLA (last layer activations) by project it onto lower dimension space using
   T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) algorithm.
2. in addition, it animate the algorithm training progress as series of activations scatter plots (in 2D).

## To run:
1. to run only the animation class use: python tsne_animation.py
2. to train the model, then visualize its activations, use: mnist_tsne.py
