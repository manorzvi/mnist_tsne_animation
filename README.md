# mnist_tsne_animation
1. Visualization of MNIST network LLA (last layer activations) by project it onto lower dimension space using
   T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) algorithm.
2. In addition, it animate the algorithm training progress as series of activations prohections scatter plot (in 2D).

## To run:
1. train mnist model by run: mnist_tsne.py
2. create gif of tsne projections of the actination by run: tsne_animation.py
3. Dont forget to warship the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
