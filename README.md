# mnist_tsne_animation
1. Visualization of MNIST network LLA (last layer activations) by project it onto lower dimension space using
   T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) algorithm.
2. In addition, it animate the algorithm training progress as series of activations scatter plots (in 2D).

## To run:
1. To run only the animation class use: python tsne_animation.py
2. To train the model, then visualize its activations, use: mnist_tsne.py
